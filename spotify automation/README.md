# Spotify Data Automation Project

This project is designed to automate the process of extracting data from Spotify's API. The main script, spotify.py, collects data on the top 100 tracks and artists on Spotify for a given time period, and saves the data as a CSV file.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a Spotify developer account and set up your API keys. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

spotipy
pandas

Once you have your API keys and have installed the required libraries, you can run the spotify_data.py script to collect data. Note that the script is currently not automated, so you will need to run it manually to collect data for a specific time period.


## Usage

To use this project, you can simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the spotify.py script in your preferred Python environment, update the time period you want to collect data for, and run the script. The collected data will be saved to the data/spotify_data.csv file.

## Note

Please note that this project is currently not automated, so you will need to run the script manually to collect data for a specific time period.
